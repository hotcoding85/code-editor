## Notes

Modules usually don't declare their own providers. The providers are either inherited from the calling root module or passed in.

`A module intended to be called by one or more other modules must not contain any provider blocks. A module containing its own provider configurations is not compatible with the for_each, count, and depends_on arguments that were introduced in Terraform v0.13`

Must use relative symlink https://superuser.com/questions/146231/how-do-i-create-a-relative-symbolic-link-in-linux

Run `init.sh` to initialize

terraform init environment/stage

- In Terraform cloud set working directory from the root `environments/prod` for example, then call `terraform -chdir=environments/prod` locally

To symlink var into another folder, go to the target folder first `ln -s ../../source.tf vars-*.symlink.tf`
