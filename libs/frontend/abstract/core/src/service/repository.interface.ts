/**
 * We have a repository for the frontend and the backend. The frontend repository should handle nested creates and updates. Since frontend API calls are more costly, we want to be able to update a graph of data in a single call
 *
 * This is not required for backend as we can more easily call the API without delay. Backend just connects the relationships
 *
 * @template Model is our working model's interface
 * @template ModelFragment is the GraphQL fragment return type, we don't actually use this value though. Since we use optimistic update by modifying mobx model cache before calling the API
 * @template Where where clause, at least need to implement ID
