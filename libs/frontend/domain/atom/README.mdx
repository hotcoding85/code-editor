# Atom

An `Atom` is the fundamental building block of the web page.

![Component Module](/uploads/modules-component.png){width=400}

```typescript
interface Atom {
  type: AtomType
}
```

It could be an HTML element,

```typescript
type AtomType = 'div' | 'p' | 'a' | 'h1'
```

or an Antd Design component.

```typescript
type AtomType = 'AntdButton' | 'AntdMenu'
```

The `admin` creates atoms via the UI for `users` to use. The `atom` model is just a container with data, and it performs it's function using a factory function that lives in code.

```typescript
const atomDivData = {
  type: 'div',
}
```

The `type` property will determine it's atom functionality.

Each `Atom` has different data requirements, so we use `propType` as validation to determine which props can be associated with it.

## What's Next

But how can we create variants of an `Atom` and re-use them in our UI? Let's say we want to create a danger & primary variant for a button atom.

We could start by adding the atom to our page, then on the page attach some props.

But how can we drag a pre-made variant to the page?

What if we wanted to use a pre-made component that itself consists of multiple atoms?

To accomplish this we need to introduce a system of creating re-useable components.

With the help of [ComponentElement](/modules/component/component-element)
then `Component` later on, we can accomplish this.
