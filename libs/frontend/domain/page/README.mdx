# Page

A `Page` is what holds our components together.

![Page Module](/uploads/modules-page.png){width=400}

A `Page` is a graph like `Component`.

```typescript
interface Page {
  elements: PageElement[]
  links: PageLink[]
}
```

It constructs the proper tree structure of our `PageElement`, but what is a PageElement?

Just as we needed `ComponentElement` to give identity to `Atom` in order to create variants. We need `PageElement` to give identity to `Component` in order to instantiate the UI.

We can attach props & styles to `PageElement`, and some merge algorithm will resolve conflicts with respect to props & styles on our `Component`
