For parsing, we are generating data for the database from hard coded data.

1. Tag Tree

- This contains the entire hierarchical tag tree data. In Ant Design, all tags are ordered within a category tag (which is the only type of tag that has no atom assignment, all other tags are assigned to atoms)

2. We have the CSV file to atom type map, this allows us to know which atom it uses.
