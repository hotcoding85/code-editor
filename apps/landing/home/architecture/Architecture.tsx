      <p>
        Codelab is a purpose built frontend layer meant to be used with external
        API services. It’s designed from the ground up as a full-fledged
        frontend solution. Use existing UI Frameworks or custom components to
        build your view, and maintain them easily with our built-in design
        system. Manage local state & connect to remote API’s.
